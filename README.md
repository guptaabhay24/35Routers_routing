# 35Routers_routing

This repository provides examples and configurations for routing using Cisco Packet Tracer.
Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation tool that allows users to create and configure virtual networks, including routers and switches.

Getting Started
To get started with routing using Cisco Packet Tracer, follow these steps:

1)Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer from the official Cisco website.
2)Launch Cisco Packet Tracer and create a new project.
3)Drag and drop routers and switches onto the workspace to build your network topology.
4)Connect the devices using appropriate cables.
5)Configure IP addresses on the interfaces of the routers and switches.
6)Configure routing protocols such as OSPF, EIGRP, or RIP on the routers.
7)Test the connectivity between devices using ping or other network testing tools.

Here, I have done routing using 35 routers and some switches etc. The packet is successfully going from one PC to another.
